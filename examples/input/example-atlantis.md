# Chronicles of the Sunken City

_Fragments recovered from the abyssal archives..._

## The Elder Runes

Found etched upon the great monolith at the city's heart. Their meaning remains elusive, but power radiates from them.

*   **Rune of Tides (🌊):** Believed to control local currents.
*   **Rune of Depths (🦑):** Possibly relates to the colossal guardians.
*   **Rune of Whispers (🐚):** Said to carry echoes of the ancients.

## Expedition Log: Dr. Aris Thorne

**Cycle 7, Phase 3:**
We've breached the outer perimeter. The pressure is immense, but the submersible *'Nautilus'* holds. Bioluminescent flora illuminates structures of impossible geometry. Readings show energy signatures unlike anything known.

**Cycle 8, Phase 1:**
Encountered automated sentinels near the central spire. Activated `Stealth Mode`. Their energy weapons are formidable. Lost drone 3 to a containment field.

| Artifact ID | Description            | Origin         | Power Level |
|-------------|------------------------|----------------|-------------|
| ATL-001     | Crystalline Orb        | Central Spire  | Fluctuating |
| ATL-007     | Trident Fragment       | Temple Ruins   | Dormant     |
| ATL-012     | Resonating Conch Shell | Whispering Cave| High        |

> **Researcher's Note:** The Conch Shell (ATL-012) reacts strongly to specific sonic frequencies. It seems to be some kind of key or communication device. Further analysis required. The city sleeps, but it is not dead.

Beware the currents.
