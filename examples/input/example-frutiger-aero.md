# Project "Skyscape" - Design & Development Notes

Brainstorming session and progress tracking for the new social networking platform.

## Core Features

*   **Profile Customization:**
    *   Glossy widgets (Weather, Music Player)
    *   Transparent profile card elements
    *   Customizable color schemes (presets focus on blues/greens)
*   **Activity Feed:** Smooth transitions (fade-in/slide), subtle animations on hover.
*   **Photo Sharing:** High-quality previews, lightbox gallery with reflections.
*   **Real-time Chat:** Clean interface, possibly with bubble effects and notification sounds.

## Design Language: Frutiger Aero

-   **Colors:** Utilize shades of blue, green, and white primarily. Gradients are key.
-   **Imagery:** Incorporate natural imagery (sky, water drops, grass) subtly in backgrounds or icons.
-   **UI Elements:** Focus on clarity, rounded corners, glossy buttons, glassmorphism for panels.
-   **Typography:** Use `Segoe UI` or similar clean sans-serif fonts.
-   **Goal:** Evoke feelings of optimism, clarity, connection, and freshness.

## Tech Stack Considerations

| Area      | Technology        | Notes                                    |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Frontend  | React             | Component-based, large ecosystem         |
| Styling   | Styled-components | Good for dynamic styling & theming       |
| State Mgt | Zustand/Redux     | TBD based on complexity                  |
| Backend   | Node.js (Express) | Familiar, good for real-time features    |
| Database  | PostgreSQL        | Reliable, good for relational data     |

### Frontend Code Snippet
```javascript
// Frontend idea: React with styled-components
import styled, { keyframes } from 'styled-components';

const fadeIn = keyframes`
  from { opacity: 0; transform: translateY(10px); }
  to { opacity: 1; transform: translateY(0); }
`;

const GlassPanel = styled.div`
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.6);
  backdrop-filter: blur(8px);
  border-radius: 8px;
  border: 1px solid rgba(200, 220, 255, 0.5);
  padding: 15px;
  animation: ${fadeIn} 0.5s ease-out;
`;
```

## Accessibility Checkpoints

1.  Ensure sufficient contrast ratios, especially on glass elements.
2.  Provide text alternatives for icons and images.
3.  Ensure keyboard navigability.
4.  Test with screen readers.

> **Reminder:** Maintain consistency across the platform. User experience is paramount.

We want to evoke a feeling of **optimism**, **clarity**, and **connection**.
