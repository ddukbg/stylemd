# PROJECT CHIMERA - STATUS LOG

**Entry Date:** Classified
**Operator:** Unit 734

## System Scan Results

- Anomaly detected Sector Gamma-9 coordinates: `[34.0522 N, 118.2437 W]` (Error Margin: +/- 5m)
- Signal Signature: **Unknown Origin**. Pattern inconsistent with known terrestrial or orbital sources.
- Energy Fluctuations: Peaking at **1.21 Gigawatts** (transient).

## Analysis Protocols Engaged

1.  Cross-referencing signal pattern with `Project Blue Book` archives... Negative match.
2.  Initiating deep-space spectral analysis...
3.  Deploying probe `XR-01` for close-range observation (ETA: 4 Hours).

***

## Tactical Recommendations

*   Maintain Level 3 Alert Status.
*   Scramble Response Team Alpha on standby.
*   Restrict all network access outside `FIREWALL PROTOCOL ZED`.

## Recovered Datapad Fragment

## Known Contacts

| Codename | Affiliation | Status      |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| GREYMAN  | Unknown     | Monitoring  |
| ORION    | Off-World?  | Intermittent|
| SENTINEL | Internal    | Active      |

> Operator Note: Increased chatter detected on encrypted channels matching SENTINEL's signature after the anomaly. Coincidence? Requires further investigation. Avoid direct contact with ORION until probe data is received.
