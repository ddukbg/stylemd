# My Document

This is a simple document, like something you might write in Notepad or WordPad back in the day.

## Meeting Notes (1998-10-26)

*   Discussed the **Y2K bug**. Steve thinks it's overblown.
*   Reviewed Q3 sales figures. Margins are down slightly.
*   Plan the office Halloween party.
    *   Need to buy more candy corn.
    *   Brenda volunteered to make spooky punch.

## To-Do List

1.  Fix the printer jam (again!).
2.  Respond to email from marketing.
3.  Prepare presentation for Friday.

## Thoughts

> Remember to defragment the hard drive this weekend. It's getting slow.

Maybe I should learn `HTML`? Seems like this "internet" thing might stick around. Need to check the `AUTOEXEC.BAT` file later for the Sound Blaster settings.

## Simple Budget

| Category      | Budget | Actual |
