# Grandma's Apple Crumble Recipe

*A family favorite, perfect for a cozy evening!* - From Mom's recipe box.

## Ingredients

**For the Filling:**

*   6 medium Apples (Granny Smith or Honeycrisp work well), peeled, cored, and sliced
*   1/4 cup Granulated Sugar
*   1 tbsp Lemon Juice
*   1 tsp Ground Cinnamon
*   1/4 tsp Nutmeg

**For the Crumble Topping:**

*   1 cup All-purpose Flour
*   1/2 cup Brown Sugar, packed
*   1/2 cup Cold Butter, cut into small pieces
*   1/2 tsp Cinnamon (optional)

## Instructions

1.  **Preheat** your oven to 375°F (190°C).
2.  In a large bowl, gently toss the **apple slices** with the granulated sugar, lemon juice, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Pour this mixture into a 9-inch baking dish.
3.  To make the **crumble topping**, combine the flour and brown sugar in a separate bowl.
4.  Cut in the **cold butter** using a pastry blender, two knives, or your fingertips until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
5.  Sprinkle the crumble topping evenly over the apple mixture.
6.  **Bake** for 35-45 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the apples are bubbly and tender.
7.  Let it cool slightly before serving. Wonderful with a scoop of vanilla ice cream!

> The tomato plants are finally starting to take off! Remembered to water the herbs this morning. Need to watch out for those pesky aphids on the roses again.

Planning to plant some zucchini next week if the weather holds. Maybe try that new `companion planting` technique I read about?
